# Emotion Detection with Deep Learning 🤖😊😢😡  

This is my deep learning project where I built and compared different **CNN architectures** to perform **human emotion detection** from facial images.  
The project is deployed as a **Streamlit web app**, where users can upload an image or use their webcam to detect emotions in real-time.

## 🌟 Project Overview  

The goal of this project was to explore how different neural network architectures perform on the task of **emotion classification**.  
I experimented with both **training models from scratch** and **fine-tuning pre-trained models**.  

The project also includes a **Streamlit-based deployment** to make the model interactive and user-friendly.

## ⚙️ Architectures Explored  

- **LeNet-5 (from scratch)** 🏗️  
  - A classic CNN architecture, simple and lightweight.  
- **ResNet Architecture** 🔄  
  - Residual connections helped achieve deeper network training.  
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** 🔬  
  - Implemented ViT from scratch for experimentation.  
  - Also fine-tuned Google’s pre-trained ViT model.
